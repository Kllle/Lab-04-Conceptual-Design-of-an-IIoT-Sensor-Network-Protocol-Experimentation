Conceptual Design of an IIoT Sensor Network

this lab focuses on simulating Iot sensors, transmitting data using MQTT and CoAP protocols, and visualizing real-time data using Python. The objective is go gain hands-on experience with Iot communication protocols, data handling, and dynamic visualization techniques.

Features
1. MQTT Sensor Simulation:
  - Publishes real-time temperature and humidity data to an MQTT broker.
  - Implements data transmission and topic-based subscription.

2. CoAP Sensor Simulation:
  - Sends temperature and humidity data to a CoAP server.
  - Utilizes the CoAP protocol for lightweight data transfer.

3. Real-Time Data Visualization:
  - Dynamically plots temperature and humidity using Matplotlib.
  - Updates in real-time as data is received from the sensors.
